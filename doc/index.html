<h1>CS 1410: Word Zap!</h1>

<hr/>

<p>Game rules: each player begins the game with seven letters. Players take turns
eliminating their letters by forming words that use their letters (but only
their letters), and the first player to eliminate all of their letters wins. If
a player cannot form a valid word using their letters, they may choose to pass
their turn and receive an additional letter. Letters are selected randomly by
the game.</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Assignment</h2>

<p>Your assignment is to create a Python program that uses a class that represents
a player to play the game described above for two or more players.</p>

<p>Your program will start by asking how many players will play the game, and then
ask for the name of each of the players. Seven random letters should be assigned
to each player, and then game play should begin.</p>

<p>For each player, in turn, your program will print the player&#39;s name and their
letters, and then ask the player for a word. Your program should check to ensure
that the word entered by the player consists only of the player&#39;s letters (and
also ensure that the player does not use a letter more times than that letter
occurs in the player&#39;s letters).</p>

<p>If the word contains a letter that the player does not have, then this word
should be discarded without any effect to the game, and the player should be
asked for another word. Otherwise, all letters used by the word should be
eliminated from the player&#39;s letters.</p>

<p>If the player does not enter a word, then their turn should be considered a
pass, and an additional random letter should be added to the player&#39;s letters.</p>

<p>After the last player completes their turn, game play should continue with the
first player and proceed until a player eliminates all of their letters. At this
point, the name of the winner should be printed and your program should
terminate. The game should wait until the end of a round to check if a player
has won. (Previously, the instructions said you could choose when to check this,
but the tests do not give you that flexibility.)</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Sample</h2>

<p>Program execution:</p>

<pre><code class="language-language-text">Welcome! Time to play! Try to use all of your letters.
The first player that uses all of their letters wins!

How many players will be playing? 2
Enter the name for player #1: Luke
Enter the name for player #2: Leia

Great! Now we can play!

Luke, it is your turn!
Your letters are: s n s a w n o
Enter a word to play (or press enter to pass) saw
Great job!

Leia, it is your turn!
Your letters are: t a h e e d b
Enter a word to play (or press enter to pass) heed
Great job!

Okay! Next round!

Luke, it is your turn!
Your letters are: n s n o
Enter a word to play (or press enter to pass) sons
Check your letters and try again!

Luke, it is your turn!
Your letters are: n s n o
Enter a word to play (or press enter to pass)
You get another letter, &#34;l&#34;!

Leia, it is your turn!
Your letters are: t a b
Enter a word to play (or press enter to pass) bat
Great job!

Leia wins!!

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>For this assignment you will work in two files: <code>player.py</code> and <code>main.py</code>.</p>

<p>You must follow the specifications exactly, but may choose your own method for
solving the problem described for each.</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Instructions for <code>player.py</code></h2>

<p>Create a new class <code>Player</code></p>

<h3>Data Members</h3>

<h4><code>name</code></h4>

<p>A string containing the user&#39;s entered name.</p>

<h4><code>letters</code></h4>

<p>A list containing the letters in the player&#39;s hand.</p>

<h3>Methods</h3>

<h4><code>__init__</code></h4>

<p>The constructor takes 1 parameter <code>name</code> a string. It should store the name and
initialize a data member <code>letters</code> a list to store the users letters.</p>

<pre><code class="language-language-python">p = Player(&#39;Luke&#39;)
</code></pre>

<h4><code>getName</code></h4>

<p>This method receives no additional parameters and returns the value of the
<code>name</code> data member.</p>

<pre><code class="language-language-python">p = Player(&#39;Leia&#39;)
p.getName() -&gt; &#39;Leia&#39;
</code></pre>

<h4><code>getLetters</code></h4>

<p>This method receives no additional parameters and returns the value of the
<code>letters</code> data member. This should currently return an empty list until the next
method is created.</p>

<pre><code class="language-language-python">p = Player(&#39;Luke&#39;)
p.getLetters() -&gt; []
</code></pre>

<h4><code>drawLetter</code></h4>

<p>This method adds a randomly chosen letter and adds it to the player&#39;s list of
letters, it returns the letter the player drew. You might consider using the
code below to choose your letter from (it is the character frequency of letters
in a popular anagram game)</p>

<pre><code class="language-language-python">letters = &#39;aaaaaaaaabbccddddeeeeeeeeeeeeffggghhiiiiiiiiijkllllmmnnnnnnooooooooppqrrrrrrssssttttttuuuuvvwwxyyz&#39;
</code></pre>

<p>example usage:</p>

<pre><code class="language-language-python">p = Player(&#39;Leia&#39;)
p.getLetters() -&gt; []
p.drawLetter() -&gt; &#39;a&#39; # random letter
p.getLetters() -&gt; [&#39;a&#39;]
p.drawLetter() -&gt; &#39;n&#39; # random letter
p.getLetters() -&gt; [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;n&#39;]
</code></pre>

<p>After you finish this method, update your constructor to call it 7 times so a
player will start out with 7 random letters in their hand. <em>Note: because the
letters are chosen at random your output will be different than the examples.</em></p>

<pre><code class="language-language-python">p = Player(&#39;Luke&#39;)
p.getLetters() -&gt; [&#39;n&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;f&#39;, &#39;g&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;z&#39;]

p2 = Player(&#39;Leia&#39;)
p2.getLetters() -&gt; [&#39;u&#39;, &#39;s&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;n&#39;]
</code></pre>

<h4><code>printLetters</code></h4>

<p>This method takes the user&#39;s letters and formats them into a pretty printed
form. It should return a string of the letters separated by a single space.
There should be no trailing space.</p>

<pre><code class="language-language-python">p2 = Player(&#39;Leia&#39;)
p2.getLetters() -&gt; [&#39;u&#39;, &#39;s&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;n&#39;]
p2.printLetters() -&gt; &#39;u s b a c e n&#39;
</code></pre>

<h4><code>checkWord</code></h4>

<p>This method takes 1 additional parameter <code>word</code> a string. If the word contains a
letter that the player does not have, or the player does not have enough copies
of the letter it should return <code>False</code>. Otherwise, update the player&#39;s current
letters removing the letters used to play the word and then return <code>True</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-language-python">p = Player(&#39;Luke&#39;)
# you might consider temporarily forcing the letters while testing
# make sure to reference your data member storing the letters.
p.letters = [&#39;n&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;f&#39;, &#39;g&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;z&#39;]
p.getLetters() -&gt; [&#39;n&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;f&#39;, &#39;g&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;z&#39;]
p.checkWord(&#39;feed&#39;) -&gt; False
p.getLetters() -&gt; [&#39;n&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;f&#39;, &#39;g&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;z&#39;]
p.checkWord(&#39;gag&#39;) -&gt; False
p.getLetters() -&gt; [&#39;n&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;f&#39;, &#39;g&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;z&#39;]
p.checkWord(&#39;gene&#39;) -&gt; True
p.getLetters() -&gt; [&#39;f&#39;, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;z&#39;]
</code></pre>

<hr/>

<h2>Instructions for <code>main.py</code></h2>

<p>We are not providing detailed instructions for <code>main.py</code>. It is up to you to
figure out how to finish the game using the player class. Here is a list of
functions that might be useful to you. You are not required to create any of
them. <em>As you work on this if you see any other functions that might be useful
to other students feel free to suggest them.</em></p>

<ul>
<li><code>getUserInt</code> - Similar to <code>getUserFloat</code> from the previous two assignments but
instead of casting the user input to a <code>float</code>, cast it to an <code>int</code></li>
<li><code>getUserString</code> - Similar to <code>getUserString</code> from previous assignments, except
an empty string should be ok (so a user can skip their turn)</li>
<li><code>getPlayers</code> - Ask the user how many players will be playing (consider using
<code>getUserInt</code>). Ask the user for a name and create an instance of <code>Player</code> for
the number of entered players. Return a list of the <code>Player</code> instances.</li>
<li><code>convertToLower</code> - Convert a user&#39;s entered <code>word</code> to lowercase. So if they
type in an <code>A</code> it counts as <code>a</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your file should consist of a <code>main()</code> function which is called to execute your
program.</p>

<p>In order to pass the tests, your main function should follow the pattern that
was outlined in the Sample section above, in addition to other potential corner
cases. This means that your program should allow the user(s) to:</p>

<ul>
<li>enter the number of players</li>
<li>enter the name of each player</li>
<li>enter a word guess for each player for each turn</li>
<li>require the player to try again if they enter an invalid word</li>
<li>win the game when they run out of letters</li>
<li>end the game as soon as a player runs out of letters (no ties)</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h3>Finishing Up</h3>

<p>Lastly add this snippet at the bottom of your file which will execute your
<code>main()</code> function when you run <code>main.py</code> but will allow it to be imported
into the unittest files without executing the main function.</p>

<pre><code class="language-language-python">if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;:
    main()
</code></pre>
